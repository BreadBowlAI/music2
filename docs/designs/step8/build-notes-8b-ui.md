# 8b-ui: build notes

What each slice of the `8b-ui` track did, and what its checks said. The track builds the screens for
mute and solo, clips, hearing notes as you draw them (audition) and meters. Its plan is
`~/m2-runs/s8ui/plan.md`. The lead took every open question's default (Q1 to Q24). For Q15 that means:
no DSP pill and no master meter in the top bar; the status pill says "Heavy load" and "Sound dropped
out"; the master meter sits on the Song row.

All runs are on Linux (jerry-ax102), in the worktree `~/m2-runs/wt/ui`, branch `8b-ui`. Each slice
adds its own section here, in the same commit.

## In short

| Step | What the user gets | State |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Nothing new to see. The back ends of 8b-backend are merged in. A deleted track no longer leaves its mute behind | done |
| U0 | Nothing new to see, except the roll's grid control now comes from a shared file. The places the lanes fill are ready | done |

## Setup: the merges

**In short**
- `8b-ui` starts from taste-next (`c988572`) and merges 8b-backend (`41dabc7`, B1 to B6 and B9 to B12).
- Only three files conflicted. In each, both sides had added lines. Both were kept.
- A track deleted with the builder now forgets its mute and solo. A new track under an old key starts
  heard. A new test shows it.
- Checks: 717 Rust tests pass in the seven crates the merge touched. Clippy is clean.

### What was built

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `44091ab` | The merge (`rerere` on, so 8b-backend can replay these resolutions when it lands). `core/play/src/lib.rs`: taste's play and stop count beside 8b's live notes and running flag. `docs/architecture.md`: RENDER-29 keeps taste's words and adds 8b.6's sentence; both sides' bullets kept. `docs/gaps.md` #8: Stop All Sound works (taste), audition's back end is built (8b). |
| this commit | `forget_overlays` wired in (refresh.md Q7), with its test and these notes |

### The `forget_overlays` wiring

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `Graph::add_track`, `Graph::duplicate_track` | After the edit, the new track's key is forgotten: a mute kept for an old track of that name doesn't mute the new one |
| `Graph::delete_track` | After a delete that went through (200), its key is forgotten. A 409 (other tracks read it) forgets nothing |
| Why in `Graph`, not the routes | The routes and any other caller get it the same way |
| Undo of a delete | The track comes back heard. Listening mutes are not undo steps (design-8b §18 B16) |
| Test | `crates/server/src/graph/forget_tests.rs` (a new file, refresh.md G4): `a_deleted_track_forgets_its_mute_and_a_new_one_starts_heard` |

std.wasm: no conflict. Neither side touched `std/kernels-src`, so it wasn't rebuilt.

### Checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo build --locked --workspace --all-targets` | ok; `Cargo.lock` unchanged |
| `cargo test --locked -p m2-server -p m2-editor -p m2-session -p m2-play -p m2 -p m2-script -p music2-desktop` | 717 passed, 0 failed (m2-server 208, m2-editor 210 + 3, m2-session 152, m2-script 55 + 8, m2-play 19 + 40, m2 15, music2-desktop 7) |
| `cargo clippy --locked` on the same crates, `--all-targets -- -D warnings` | clean |
| Log | `~/m2-runs/logs/ui-test-1017-060706-268687.log` |

**Red first:** the new test on the merge alone (the wiring taken out, the test kept) fails at its first
check after the delete: hats' mute stays, `["hats", "synth-pluck"]` where `["synth-pluck"]` was
wanted (`~/m2-runs/logs/ui-forget-red-*.log`). With the wiring it passes.

### Left

- A track renamed by key keeps its mute (8b-backend's `rekey`). Nothing to wire.
- The CLI's `m2 add-track` and `m2 delete-track` open their own session: they leave `overlays.json` as
  it was. The app's next add or delete of that key cleans it.
