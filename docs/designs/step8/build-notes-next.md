# Next: build notes

What each part of the next track built, its tests, the red run before each change, and what is
left. The plan is `~/m2-runs/s8n/plan.md`. Each part writes only under its own heading.

## P0

The lead's seams.

## Lane A

Hear it while you drag.

## Lane B

Play in: the metronome, the keyboard piano, the MIDI keyboard.

## Lane C

Settings and safety.

## Lane D

Effects and small fixes. Branch `next-d`, worktree `wt/nx-d`. Built in the order X29 sets: D4e, D1, D2, the rest of
D4, then D3.

### D4e. A first options object on its own line (Q31)

**In short**

| What | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Moving the master fader in a song written over lines | `}), { db: -2.5 },` on the mixer's last line | `{ db: -2.5 },` on a line of its own, lined up with the mixer |

**What changed**

- `crates/editor/src/lens.rs`, `Insertion::plan`, the arm that writes a new options object after the last argument:
  when the call's first argument starts on a new line after its `(`, the object goes on a line of its own at the last
  argument's indent. After the last argument's comma when it has one (`\n    { db: -2.5 },`), else with a comma
  before it (`,\n    { db: -2.5 }`). A line comment after that comma stays after the new object. A call on one
  line, or one whose first argument starts on the `(`'s line (`master(mixer({\n …\n }))`), is written as before.
- The empty call written over lines (plan D4e) is not built: no std component takes only options, so nothing reaches
  it.
- History's words don't change: `fold` drops the line breaks and the comma before `)`, so it still says
  `master(…, { db: -2.5 })`.

**Tests**

- `crates/editor`: `a_first_options_object_goes_on_its_own_line` (five calls: over lines with and without a trailing
  comma, a tab indent with a line comment, one line, first argument on the `(`'s line; each undone back to the
  bytes). `the_master_fader_writes_master` (`mix_tests.rs`) now expects the object's own line. 282 of 282
  `m2-editor` tests, clippy clean.
- `s8-mix` reads the code it writes: the master's `{ db: … },` must be on its own line, between the mixer's `}),`
  and `),`. 80 of 80. `taste` 39 of 39.

**Red first**

- The test without the `lens.rs` change:
  `left: "…master(\n    mixer({ a: osc.sine(220) }), { ceiling: -3 },\n  ),…"` against
  `right: "…master(\n    mixer({ a: osc.sine(220) }),\n    { ceiling: -3 },\n  ),…"`.
- `s8-mix` on the server from before (`bin/d-70f9b61`):
  `FAIL  the master's fader writes master(…, { db: … }) on its own line: "…    }), { db: -4.8 },\n  ),\n);\n"`.

**Left:** the empty call written over lines (nothing reaches it).

**For gaps.md:** none (a fix).

**Contract:** an options object the app writes into a call written over lines gets a line of its own.
