# How a song is written

**In short**
- A song is a folder: `music2.toml`, `song.ts` (the mix), one file per track in `tracks/`, and the data in `data/`.
- This page shows each file, the units, the SDK (`@m2/core`) and how to declare your own component.
- The app edits the code for you, one small checked change at a time.

## The folder

```
my-song/
  music2.toml          # the song's name, its format and sample rate, and the SDK and packages it uses
  song.ts              # the mix: which tracks play, how loud, and the master
  tracks/
    bass.ts            # one file per track: its lanes, instrument and effects
  data/
    arrangement.json   # tempo and time signature
    bass/              # one folder per track, named by its key
      notes.json       # one file per lane: data/<track key>/<lane key>.json
      cutoff.json      # (a key that is a Windows device name, such as aux, is written aux-)
  assets/              # audio files (WAV), never overwritten
  layout.json          # the tracks' order and colours: shown, never heard
  AGENTS.md            # for AI agents working on the song: what is here, the rules, where m2 is
  CLAUDE.md            # the same for Claude Code: one line, @AGENTS.md. The app ignores both
  .music2/             # this machine's: not part of the song, and not in git
```

`music2.toml` looks like this:

```toml
[project]
name = "My song"
format = 1
sample_rate = 48000

[dependencies]
"@m2/core" = "1"
std = "0.4"
```

`arrangement.json` holds `tempo` (a list of `{ "beat", "bpm" }` changes, the first at beat 0) and `meter` (a list of `{ "beat", "beats", "unit" }` time signatures; empty is 4/4). A beat is a quarter note.

`layout.json` is written the first time you move, recolour or add a track: `{"order": ["kick", "hats", …], "tracks": {"kick": {"colour": "rose"}, …}}`. A colour is one of the twelve names (rose, teal, amber, indigo, green, plum, olive, blue, coral, cyan, violet, lime). A track that is missing for a while (commented out of `song.ts`) keeps its place and colour there, and keys the app doesn't know are kept as they are. If it stops being valid JSON (a git merge can leave `<<<<<<<` lines in it), the tracks show in their own order and colours, the status pill says so, and **Reset layout** there writes the default one over it (Undo brings the old text back).

Tracks, lanes and plugins are filed under their keys: short names in lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, such as `lead-vox`. A key is written in the code, so renaming a track's label never moves its data.

## A track

This is a whole track, the shape of `tracks/hats.ts`:

```ts
import { track } from "@m2/core";
import { hat } from "std/instruments";

export default track("hats", { name: "Hats" }, ({ lane }) => hat(lane.notes("hits")));
```

- `track("hats", { name: "Hats" }, …)` makes a track with the key `hats`, shown as Hats. Without the options, `track("hats", fn)`, it is shown by its key. Its data is filed under the key, so changing the name moves nothing; changing the key leaves its data behind until you move it (the app offers to).
- `lane.notes("hits")` is a notes lane with the key hits. Its clips are in `data/hats/hits.json`. `lane.notes("hits", { name: "Hits" })` gives it a label too.
- `hat(…)` is the hi-hat instrument from std. It plays those notes.

## The mix

`song.ts` says what you hear. Here the bass ducks (dips in volume) each time the kick hits, which is called a sidechain. The numbers are only examples.

```ts
import { db, song } from "@m2/core";
import { duck } from "std/fx";
import { master, mixer } from "std/mix";
import bass from "./tracks/bass";
import hats from "./tracks/hats";
import kick from "./tracks/kick";

export default song(() =>
  master(
    mixer({
      kick: kick.out,
      hats: { in: hats.out, db: db(-8), pan: 0.2 }, // quieter, a little to the right
      bass: duck(bass.out, kick.env, { depth: db(-10) }),
    }),
  ),
);
```

`kick.env` is how loud the kick is right now. The kick track exports it next to its sound; see `examples/first-song/tracks/kick.ts`.

## Notes

```json
{"clips": [
  {"id": "k3f9q2zt", "start": 0, "length": 4, "notes": [
    {"pitch": "F#2", "start": 0.5, "length": 0.25, "velocity": 0.9},
    {"pitch": 42, "start": 1.5, "length": 0.25}
  ]}
]}
```

- `pitch` is a note name (`"F#2"`, `"Bb3"`) or a number (60 is middle C, so `42` is F#2).
- A clip's `start` and `length` are in beats from the start of the song. A note's `start` and `length` are in beats from the start of its clip.
- `velocity` goes from 0 to 1. Without it, a note gets 0.8.
- `id` names the clip. music2 gives every clip it writes one; a clip without one still plays.
- music2 writes these files in one form, one clip and one note per line, so they diff well. The order of clips and notes in a file never changes what plays.

Automation and mask clips hold `points` instead of notes: `[beat, value]` pairs, with straight lines in between, and their file records the lane's unit (`{"unit": "hz", "clips": [...]}`). Audio clips name a file in `assets/`, pin it with `hash` (the first 16 hex digits of its SHA-256), and can have `offset`, `gain_db`, `fade_in`, `fade_out`, `reverse`, `pitch` and `warp`; see `examples/resample/data/chops/clips.json`.

## Units

A number in the code can carry a unit, written as a function. Plugging a value with the wrong unit into an input is an error. A plain number fits any unit.

| Write | Means |
|---|---|
| `hz(440)`, `khz(2.5)` | a frequency |
| `db(-6)` | a level in decibels |
| `linear(0.5)` | a gain as a plain multiplier |
| `semis(12)` | semitones (12 is an octave) |
| `secs(0.3)`, `ms(30)` | a time |
| `beats(0.5)` | a length in beats |
| `frac(0.5)` | a fraction from 0 to 1 |
| `bipolar(-0.3)` | a value from -1 to 1, like pan |
| `scalar(2)` | a number with no unit |

## The SDK (`@m2/core`)

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| `track(key, { name }?, fn)` | a track: `fn` gets `{ key, lane, time }` and returns its sound, or an object of named outputs such as `{ out, env }`. `name` is its label; code never sees it |
| `song(fn)` | the root module in `song.ts`, with the key `song`: whatever it returns is what you hear |
| `lane.notes(key)`, `lane.control(key, unit, fallback)`, `lane.mask(key)`, `lane.audio(key)` | the timeline lanes, each with an optional last argument `{ name, shared }` |
| `key(k, fn)` | runs `fn` in a frame named `k`, which files the saved settings of the plugins built inside it under `k` |
| `time.beats`, `time.seconds`, `time.playing` | the song's position, and 1 while it plays (0 while stopped). A track gets `time` in its `fn`; a component's body imports it from `@m2/core` |
| `poly(notes, voice, { voices, mode, retrigger, steal, glide })` | plays a voice for each note at once (`voices`, 16); or one note at a time, each starting again (`mode: "mono"`) or sliding from the one held (`"legato"`) over `glide` seconds; `retrigger: false` carries a voice on into its next note; `steal` says which note stops when too many are held: `"oldest"`, `"quietest"` or `"none"` |
| `feedback(kind)` | a loop with a short delay; give its input later with `.set()` |
| `kernel(id, inputs)` | one kernel, such as `kernel("std:svf", { … })` |
| `plugin("clap:<id>", inputs)` | a CLAP plugin; `key` in its inputs names its saved settings (see [CLAP plugins](plugins.md)) |
| `component({ id, inputs, controls, settings, output, positional, editor }, body)` | declares a component: the signals it reads, its controls (knobs, each with a unit, a default and a range), its settings, and how the editor offers it. Every std function is one (see `std/src`); the older `component({ controls }, fn)`, which only marks which arguments are knobs, still works |

## Your own components

A function of your own becomes a box with knobs when it's declared as a component, as every std function is:

```ts
// lib/crunch.ts
import { component, control, kernel, port, signature, type Audio, type Params, type Value } from "@m2/core";

/** Drive, then a lowpass that tames the fizz. */
export const crunch = component(
  {
    id: "crunch",
    label: "Crunch",
    signature: signature<(x: Audio, amount?: Value) => Audio>(),
    inputs: { in: port.audio() },
    controls: {
      amount: control.db(12).range(0, 36).smooth(),
      tone: control.hz(3000).range(200, 20000).log().smooth(),
    },
    output: port.audio(),
    positional: ["amount"],
  },
  (x: Audio, { amount, tone }: Params) => kernel("std:svf", { in: kernel("std:drive", { in: x, amount }), cutoff: tone }).port("lp"),
);
```

- `id` is what the app knows the component by, whatever name a file imports it as. In a package it is `<package>:<id>` (`std:delay`).
- `inputs` are the signals it reads. `port.audio({ sidechain: true })` marks one that only listens, like a compressor's key input.
- Each control has a unit and a default (`control.db(12)` is 12 dB), written in that unit, like every number in the descriptor. `.range(lo, hi)` is the knob's range (a hint: a number outside it is never changed), `.log()` turns it on a log scale, `.smooth()` glides a change over one block (for a control the sound reads every sample, so a jump would click), and `.optional()` means a call that leaves it out gets no node at all. The body always gets a signal for a control, whether the call wrote a number, connected a signal or left it out.
- `settings` are values that shape the graph, such as `setting.int(4)` voices: never knobs.
- `positional` lets calls write those controls as arguments, in order: `crunch(x, 18)`. Any control can also go in an options object after them: `crunch(x, { tone: 1500 })`. A misspelt option is an error that lists the right ones.
- `editor: { category, description, insert }` puts a package's component in the effect browser, under its category, and `insert` is what adding it writes (`{ amount: 6 }`).

## When something's wrong

`m2 check` reports a problem as the file, line and column, then what's wrong. A problem in the sound graph also names the module's key and the node in square brackets.

```
song.ts:14:30: snare is not defined
std/src/filter.ts:26:40: [hats/n23] input `cutoff` expects control<hz>, got control<db>
```

The second one came from `lowpass(hat(…), db(-6))` in `tracks/hats.ts`: a filter's cutoff wants a frequency, not a level. When the wrong value goes into a std function, the line shown is inside std, so look for the call in your own file.

The app shows the same problems in the status pill's popover (click **Code doesn't compile** in the top bar) and in the code editor's list, with the file, the line and what's wrong, but without the part in square brackets.

Problems that don't stop the song (data no lane reads, a lane file that doesn't read, a missing asset or plugin) are printed by every `m2` command that opens the song, each with its code in square brackets, such as `[data.unclaimed]`, and the commands that fix it.

## Editing from the app

The code stays the source of truth; the app edits it for you, one small checked change at a time.

- A knob appears for a number written directly at an input: `0.3`, `hz(800)`, `db(-6)`, or a plain property like `{ pan: 0.3 }`.
- A knob also appears for every control a call leaves out, at the default its component declares (its number in grey). Its first turn writes the number into the call: as the next argument when that is where it goes (`lowpass(x, 1000)` becomes `lowpass(x, 1000, 0.8)`), else in the call's options (`{ release: ms(150), attack: 0.01 }`), else in new ones. A knob's range is the one its component declares.
- Computed values (`2 * 440`, a variable holding a plain number) and objects with spreads, getters or computed keys still work, but show **edit in code** instead of a knob.
- A shared value such as `const cutoff = hz(800)` shows as one box wired to every place it's used. Turning it changes all of them.
- Parentheses and comments around a number are kept.
- Before writing anything, the app compiles the new code and checks that only the intended thing changed: a knob changes only its number, a cable only what reads it, a rename nothing that plays.
- While the code doesn't compile, the last working version keeps playing and the knobs are locked.
- Cables inside one file, and adding or removing effects, also work. Cables between tracks, and adding or deleting other boxes, don't yet.
- Renaming a track writes, changes or takes out the `name` in its `track()` call (a name equal to the key takes it out, since the label defaults to the key). A name written as a variable is left alone: the app says to change it there.
- Automating a knob writes `lane.control("<key>", "<unit>", <the number as written>)` where the number was, adds `lane` to the track function's parameters when it isn't there (`() =>` becomes `({ lane }) =>`), and makes the empty lane file `data/<track>/<key>.json`. The key comes from the control's name (`decay`, or `hats-pan` for a mixer channel's), with the call's name in front only when the track has that key already (`pad-decay`); `{ name: … }` is written only when the key, read as words, isn't the control's label.
